  abstract = {This paper shows a new class-E amplifier topology with the objective to increase the nominal class-E output power for a given voltage and current stress on the power transistor. To obtain that result, a parallel LC resonator is added to the load network, tuned to the second harmonic of the switching frequency. A class-E power amplifier is obtained whose transistor-voltage waveform peak value is 81\% of the peak value of the voltage of a nominal class- E amplifier using the same dc supply voltage. In this amplifier, the peak voltage across the transistor is 3.0 times the dc supply voltage, instead of the 3.6 times associated with nominal class-E amplifiers. A normalized design is presented, and the behavior of the circuit is analyzed with simulation showing that the ratio of output power versus transistor peak voltage times peak current is 20.4\% better than the nominal class E. The proposed converter and normalized design approach are verified by simulations and measurements done on an experimental prototype.}}

  abstract = {The new class of amplifiers described is based on a load network synthesized to have a transient response which maximizes power efficiency even if the active device switching times are substantial fractions of the a.c. cycle. The new class of amplifiers, named `Class E,' is defined and is illustrated by a detailed description and a set of design equations for one simple member of the class. For that circuit the authors measured 96 percent transistor efficiency at 3.9 MHz at 26-W output from a pair of Motorola 2N3735 TO-5 transistors. Advantages of Class E are unusually high efficiency, a priori designability, large reduction in second-breakdown stress, low sensitivity to active-device characteristics, and potential for high-efficiency operation at higher frequencies than previously published Class-D circuits.}}

  abstract = {Class E power amplifiers achieve significantly higher efficiency than for conventional class B or C. Class E operates the transistor as an on/off switch and shapes the voltage and current waveforms to prevent simultaneous high voltage and high current in the transistor; that minimizes the power dissipation, especially during the switching transitions. In the published low-order class-E circuit, a transistor performs well at frequencies up to about 70\% of its frequency of good class-B operation. An unpublished higher-order class E circuit operates well up to about double that frequency. The paper covers circuit operation, explicit design equations for the low-order class E circuit, optimization principles, and experimental results.}}

  abstract = {This paper presents a 1-W, class-E power amplifier that is implemented in a 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology and suitable for operations up to 2 GHz. The concept of mode locking is used in the design, in which the amplifier acts as an oscillator whose output is forced to run at the input frequency. A compact off-chip microstrip balun is also proposed for output differential-to-single-ended conversion. At 2-V supply and at 1.98 GHz, the power amplifier achieves 48\% power-added efficiency (41\% combined with the balun).}}
