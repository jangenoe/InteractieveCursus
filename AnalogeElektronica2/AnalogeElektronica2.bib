  abstract = {The nodal method has been widely used for formulating circuit equations in computer-aided network analysis and design programs. However, several limitations exist in this method including the inability to process voltage sources and current-dependent circuit elements in a simple and efficient manner. A modified nodal analysis (MNA) method is proposed here which retains the simplicity and other advantages of nodal analysis while removing its limitations. A simple and effective pivoting scheme is also given. Numerical examples are used to compare the MNA method with the tableau method. Favorable results are observed for the MNA method in terms of the dimension, number of nonzeros, and fill-ins for comparable circuit matrices.},
